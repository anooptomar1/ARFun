# ARFun
Launch yourself into Augmented Reality. ARFun has three pages: the first one lets you tap to place 3d objects in AR space. The last page lets you try placing AR objects using map coordinates. Since Swift Playgrounds doesn't offer location data, the third page requires you to tap the current location of the device, followed by the location to place the "antenna".

Experimenting with ARKit requires an iOS11 iPad that supports ARKit and has the Swift Playgrounds 2 beta installed.

## Getting Started
* Open ARFun.playground using the Swift Playgrounds 2 beta on an iOS 11 beta device
* Run the playground
* Give the playground camera permissions
* Tap the screen to place an AR object
